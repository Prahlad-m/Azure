### ✅ Day 1: Cloud Fundamentals

- **What Cloud Computing Can Do**: Enables remote data access, scalable resources, and collaborative workflows.
- **Benefits for Business**: Speeds up operations, improves data accessibility, and eliminates the need for expensive on-prem hardware.
- **Cloud Providers**: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud – offering storage, computing, virtual machines, and platform services.

#### ☁️ Cloud Service Models:
| Model | Description | Real-world Use |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| IaaS  | Infrastructure as a Service | Hosting virtual machines or custom servers |
| PaaS  | Platform as a Service | Application development without infrastructure setup |
| SaaS  | Software as a Service | Web-based tools like Office 365 or Gmail |

#### ☁️ Cloud Deployment Types:
- **Public Cloud**: Shared infrastructure (e.g. startups using Azure)
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated for one organization (e.g. banks or hospitals)
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combines public + private (e.g. enterprises managing sensitive & general data)
- **Community Cloud**: Shared among similar organizations (e.g. hospitals sharing a healthcare cloud)
